# Form-A
### Yes, I agree, it's a rather ill-considered name :).
Simple form generator based on vite & vue
was originally created as a tool to facilitate the creation of WordPress admin pages, and then we'll see

#### Made for my own needs (and yes, he satisfies them). If in whole or in part it can be useful to someone, you are welcome

## Usage  (please refer to [index.html](./index.html) and [remote.js](./src/remote.js))
Place in your HTML placeholders for form(s)  (class "form-a-placeholder" is required)
```
    <form>
      <div id="local-form-1" class="form-a-placeholder">
      </div>
    </form>

    <form>
      <div id="local-form-2" class="form-a-placeholder">
      </div>
    </form>
```
